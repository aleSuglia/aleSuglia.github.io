This paper reports on the version of the system developed and evaluated in the semifinals of the 2018 competition (i.e. up to 15 August 2018), but not on subsequent enhancements. The main advances over our 2017 Alana system are:\n a deeper Natural Language Understanding (NLU) pipeline; the use of topic ontologies and Named Entity Linking to enable the user to navigate and search through a web of related information; rendering Alana in part an interactive NL interface to linked information on the web; system generated clarification questions to interactively disambiguate between Named Entities as part of NLU; a new profanity \u0026amp; abuse detection model with rule-based mitigation strategies; response retrieval from Reddit.  We also present several ablation studies that measure the performance contributions of specific features (e.g. use of Ontology-bot, Reddit-bot, rule-based systems, etc). We find that these features increase overall system performance. Our final score, namely averaged user ratings over the whole semi-finals period, was 3.4. We were also able to achieve long dialogues (average around 11 turns and 2.20 minutes) during the semi-finals period.\n","permalink":"https://alesuglia.github.io/publications/alexa_prize_2018/","tags":["NLP","Conversational AI","Alexa","Semantic Web"],"title":"Entertaining and Informative Open-domain Social Dialogue using Ontologies and Entity Linking"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Conversational Recommender Systems assist online users in their information-seeking and decision making tasks by supporting an interactive process with the aim of finding the most appealing items according to the user preferences.

Next, given such a representation, a logistic regression layer calculates the relevance score of each item for a specific user and we returns the top-N items as recommendations.\nIn the experimental session we evaluated the effectiveness of our approach against several baselines: first, we compared it to other shallow models based on neural networks (as Word2Vec and Doc2Vec), next we evaluated it against state-of-the-art algorithms for collaborative filtering. In both cases, our methodology obtains a significant improvement over all the baselines, thus giving evidence of the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in content-based recommendation scenarios and paving the way for several future research directions.\n","permalink":"https://alesuglia.github.io/publications/amar/","tags":["Recommender Systems","Deep Learning","Recurrent Neural Networks"],"title":"A deep architecture for content-based recommendations exploiting recurrent neural networks"},{"categories":null,"contents":"People have information needs of varying complexity, which can be solved by an intelligent agent able to answer questions formulated in a proper way, eventually considering user context and preferences.
