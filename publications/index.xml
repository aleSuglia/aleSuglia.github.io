      <description>We describe our 2018 Alexa prize system (called ‘Alana’) which consists of an ensemble of bots, combining rule-based and machine learning systems. This paper reports on the version of the system developed and evaluated in the semifinals of the 2018 competition (i.e. up to 15 August 2018), but not on subsequent enhancements. The main advances over our 2017 Alana system are:
 a deeper Natural Language Understanding (NLU) pipeline; the use of topic ontologies and Named Entity Linking to enable the user to navigate and search through a web of related information; rendering Alana in part an interactive NL interface to linked information on the web; system generated clarification questions to interactively disambiguate between Named Entities as part of NLU; a new profanity &amp;amp; abuse detection model with rule-based mitigation strategies; response retrieval from Reddit.</description>

      <title>Iterative multi-document neural attention for multiple answer prediction</title>

      <description>People have information needs of varying complexity, which can be solved by an intelligent agent able to answer questions formulated in a proper way, eventually considering user context and preferences. In a scenario in which the user profile can be considered as a question, intelligent agents able to answer questions can be used to find the most relevant answers for a given user. In this work we propose a novel model based on Artificial Neural Networks to answer questions with multiple answers by exploiting multiple facts retrieved from a knowledge base.</description>

      <title>An automatic procedure for generating datasets for conversational recommender systems</title>

      <description>Conversational Recommender Systems assist online users in their information-seeking and decision making tasks by supporting an interactive process with the aim of finding the most appealing items according to the user preferences. Unfortunately, collecting dialogues data to train these systems can be labour-intensive, especially for data-hungry Deep Learning models. Therefore, we propose an automatic procedure able to generate plausible dialogues from recommender systems datasets.</description>

      <title>Converse-Et-Impera: Exploiting Deep Learning and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Conversational Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>In this paper, we propose a framework based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for dialogue management in a Conversational Recommender System scenario. The framework splits the dialogue into more manageable tasks whose achievement corresponds to goals of the dialogue with the user. The framework consists of a meta-controller, which receives the user utterance and understands which goal should pursue, and a controller, which exploits a goal-specific representation to generate an answer composed by a sequence of tokens.</description>

      <title>A deep architecture for content-based recommendations exploiting recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://alesuglia.github.io/publications/amar/</link>

      <description>In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a top-N content-based recommendation scenario. Specifically, we propose a deep architecture which adopts Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to jointly learn two embeddings representing the items to be recommended as well as the preferences of the user. Next, given such a representation, a logistic regression layer calculates the relevance score of each item for a specific user and we returns the top-N items as recommendations.</description>
